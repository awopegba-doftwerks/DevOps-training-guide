Creating and configuring Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets on AWS involves several steps using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating and configuring a VPC and subnets on AWS:

### Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console

Sign in to your AWS account at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

### Step 2: Navigate to the VPC Dashboard

Go to the VPC Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top navigation bar and then clicking on "VPC" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.

### Step 3: Create a VPC

1. Click on "Create VPC" to start creating a new VPC.
2. Enter a name for your VPC and specify the IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
3. Optionally, you can configure additional settings such as IPv6 CIDR block, tenancy (default or dedicated), and DNS hostname resolution.
4. Click on "Create VPC" to create the VPC.

### Step 4: Create Subnets

1. After creating the VPC, navigate to the "Subnets" section in the VPC Dashboard.
2. Click on "Create subnet" to create a new subnet within the VPC.
3. Enter a name for the subnet and select the VPC created earlier.
4. Specify the IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
5. Choose the availability zone for the subnet.
6. Click on "Create subnet" to create the subnet.

### Step 5: Configure Route Tables

1. Go to the "Route Tables" section in the VPC Dashboard.
2. Select the default route table associated with the VPC or create a new route table.
3. Edit the route table and add a route for internet access (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to an internet gateway.
4. Associate the subnet created earlier with the route table.

### Step 6: Configure Network Access Control Lists (optional)

1. Go to the "Network ACLs" section in the VPC Dashboard.
2. Create a new network ACL or modify the default network ACL associated with the VPC.
3. Configure inbound and outbound rules to control traffic flow to and from the subnet.

### Step 7: Verify Configuration

1. Verify that the VPC and subnets are created successfully by checking the VPC Dashboard.
2. Ensure that the route table and network ACLs are configured correctly.
3. Test connectivity by launching instances in the subnet and accessing resources.

### Step 8: Clean Up (optional)

After completing the configuration and testing, you can clean up the resources by deleting the VPC, subnets, route tables, and network ACLs if they are no longer needed.

### Conclusion

Creating and configuring VPCs and subnets on AWS allows you to build isolated and secure network environments for deploying your applications and services. Following the steps outlined above will help you set up a VPC and subnets according to your requirements on the AWS cloud platform.
